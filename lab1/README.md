# Laboratory 1 - Euclides and Dijkstra's algorithms

This folder contains implementations of Euclides' and Dijkstra's algorithm in Python and Clips languages.

## Euclides' algorithm
This algorithm calculates biggest common denominator of two whole numbers.

## Dijksta's algorithm
This algorithm calculates the shortes path between starting node and all other nodes in a graph.
